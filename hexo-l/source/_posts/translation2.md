Today we feature MuseARt, an amazing app Salvador Sanchez has developed and I recommend you all.

今天我们以MuseARt为主题的神奇app Salvador Sanchez 正在发展起来，我来向你推荐

MuseARt is the first application that combines art with the most advanced technologies of AUGMENTED REALITY, TEXT TO SPEECH and IMAGE RECOGNITION in REAL TIME.

MuseARt 是第一个结合了艺术和增强现实技术应用，可以实时的结合语音和图像识别

With dozens of artworks from The Prado Museum, The Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum and The Reina Sofia Museum in Madrid.

有这么多博物馆的艺术品

MuseARt is an essential application for art lovers and for those who want to have their own audioguide when visiting a museum.

MuseARt对艺术爱好者和想有音频导航参观博物馆的人来说是一个非常必要的应用

This is a collection of artwork ordered by museums, exhibitions, galleries and specific collections created by the world’s major museums.

这是一个收集了。。。的世界博物馆

But that’s not all: MuseARt has an AUGMENTED REALITY interface that directly identifies each artwork through the camera device, displaying in real time all the information associated with it, including the audioguide in English and Spanish, made with text to speech technology with high quality interpretation and diction, provided by the latest technology in text recognition and human intonation existing in the market.

但是并不只如此，MuseARt拥有增强现实界面，可以通过摄像设备直接识别每个艺术品，实时显示有关的信息，包括英文和西班牙语的导航，用高级的语音和解释，提供最新的文字语音识别技术

The advantage of image identification system built into the application represents a significant advance in the currently existing audioguides and do not need to manually enter any identifier: only focusing the camera to the artwork achieve the identification, and visitors are not distracted by entering data into the device. This image identification system is the result of extensive research in Augmented Reality, making it more human and closer to the user.

图像识别系统在应用上的的优势在于不需要手动输入任何表符，只有聚焦摄像机识别物品，游客则不需要输入数据。这个图像识别系统是增强现实技术的成果，使其更接近于用户

The application is constantly evolving, including regular updates of artworks, exhibitions, new museums around the world and their respective audioguides.

这个应用是不断发展的,包括定期更新的艺术品,展览、新博物馆在世界各地,他们各自音频导航。

Each artwork has a high definition version that you can download for later reference even without network connection.

每个艺术品都有高清版本的可以下载，以便在没有网络的时候使用。
